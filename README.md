# Laye

Laye is a multi-paradigm programming language.

## Building this project

For the most part, this can be build like any other Java application, including
*FaxLib-Collections.jar* to your classpath.

Only the *src/* and *lib/* folders are required to be built, since the *test/*
doesn't contain relevent code outside of required testing.

The code is undocumented as of yet, so feel free to ask questions regarding
the implementation.
